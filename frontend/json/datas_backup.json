Today, the trip from Moscow to Vladivostok on board the Trans-Siberian Express train “Rossiya” and “Golden Eagle” lasts 6 days and 4 hours, and the forked rail network at Ussuriysk enables the trains to travel further 3 days toward south, across the border of North Korea and straight to their capital of Pyongyang."

The real reason for its popularity lies in its level of service and the popular stories that were centered around it (most famously by a detective novel “Murder on the Orient Express” written by Agatha Christie). The train was built and maintained as one of the most premium railway trains in the world at that time, offering high-end service and comfort for wealthy and business passengers that traveled between cities of Paris and Istanbul (then known as Constantinople). The original route was maintained between 1883 and 1977, switching to the shorter trips between Paris and Vienna. Eventually, after its schedule covered shorter and shorter routes, the name Orient Express disappeared from the European train schedules on 14 December 2009."

The great success of the commercial use of TGV in 1981 caused large expansion of high-speed railway lines across the France.
